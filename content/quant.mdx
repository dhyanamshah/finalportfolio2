We are all acquainted with our favorite show, Invincible, and while rewatching Season 1, I learned about Quantum Probability — the chip upgrade done by Machine Head.


It was surprising to know that something like Quantum Probability is supposed to be real.

## Quantum Probability — A fiction?

Many of us have likely come across a piece of fiction that depicts the existence of complex algorithms and technology capable of accurately predicting the outcome of any event, giving the characters an upper hand in many situations. Guess what? This concept is not limited to fiction — it can be achieved in real life as well. In fact, a fraction of this technology is already being used by physicists, mathematicians, and quantitative researchers through the principles of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and branches of mathematics such as stochastic calculus.

## David Deutsch’s interpretation of Quantum Mechanics

According to David Deutsch’s many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, The mathematics of quantum physics doesn’t just suggest parallel universes might exist. It proves they MUST exist.

The existence of parallel universes is explained very well in layman’s terms by physicist Michio Kaku in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Jn4SQMHAHO8).

David Deutsch developed the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm with Richard Jozsa which showed, more concretely, that quantum computers could solve certain problems exponentially faster than any classical computer.

## Quantum + Probability = Quantum Probability

How Quantum Probability is different from the concepts of Probability that we have learnt in high school?


Quantum probability is an advanced branch of mathematics that involves the use of high-speed quantum computers to simulate every possible outcome of an event within a system and determine the most probable outcome as its conclusion.

## Quantum Probability — Why do we even care?

Many of us might assume that this is high-level physics conducted by physicists, so why should we even care? And how does it affect us?

A major breakthrough in this concept could change the world as we know it today.

There are countless applications of quantum probability, one of which is predicting the outcome of a sports event — a concept that everyone can understand. Traditionally, the technology used to predict sports outcomes only takes into account a player’s performance history, weather conditions, field conditions, and possibly other major factors.

Using quantum probability, we could predict the score of the game at a certain point in the match and determine the top scorer even before the game starts. It would take into account even minor factors, such as the position of the sun, the intensity of its rays, and even atomic changes that might influence the outcome of the game.

Good for sports bettors, I guess.

One of the applications I have researched is the use of quantum probability in finance.

## Quantum Finance: The Future of Financial Modeling

A rapidly growing branch of FinTech with accelerated research backed by financial institutions such as JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.

## Why Quantum for Finance?

Classical financial models rely on traditional probability and statistics, but they struggle with high-dimensional data, extreme market events, and nonlinear dynamics. Quantum finance aims to address these limitations.

In simple terms Quantum finance will act as a leverage for institutional traders.

For example — Let us take Dakota Access Pipeline for account which transports up to 750,000 barrels of crude oil to Illinois. If the system detects any damage or rupturing of pipeline due to some natural or unnatural cause before it happens, which will lead to scarcity and increase in oil prices in Illinois, these institutional traders can go long on Crude oil commodity and can make millions after closing their positions at inflated prices with this technology.
