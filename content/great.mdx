my point of view on what it takes to be great when I'm 17

preparing for world's hardest exam with 0.2% acceptance rate and I get to meet with all various kind of people at school and most of them are studying engineering because it's a noble pursuit or because they think their success is the by product of which college they go to
I was always inspired by great minds. Instead of idolizing pop stars, I idolize Steve Jobs, Feynman and Elon Musk. I had consumed most of their interviews, blogs and their biographies.
Some of them are:
* *[Stay hungry, stay foolish](https://stevejobsarchive.com/exhibits/stay-hungry-stay-foolish) - Steve Jobs*
* *[How to Get Rich (without getting lucky)](https://x.com/naval/status/1002103360646823936) - Naval Ravikant*
* *[How To Be Successful](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful) - Sam Altman*

Reading these, I believed it takes a lot more than intelligence or iq points to be like the people I admired.
One of the most admirable quality of them was they were wise.
Wisdom is one the most rare commodity in the great 2025.
When I used to believe that I need to learn how to code to be one of the greats even though I like hardware more, These people taught me that it takes a lot more than to know how to code to be one of the greatest minds of this century. It was their ability or willingness to learn, they were curious, they understood stuff to the basics. They used to break down unknown complex problem into simple stuff that we have dealt with before. This is what Elon's  first principle system means. I remember Naval taking about one of the Feynman's lecture where he taught how to count numbers on your fingers to advance calculus. These people knew what they do. They were passionate. They were obsessed 

This trend follows in all kinds of professions, passion and obsession make you great.
passion and obsession was what made Bob Dylan a great musician
passion and obsession was what made Einstein a great scientist
passion and obsession was what made Lionel Messi a great footballer

This the main reason why you don't need iq points to be one of the greats as your obsession will allow you to think out of the box, it will led to innovation and this is how you become of the greats.

Now I don't need to learn javascript to execute the next billion dollar idea, instead I need to go all in for my interest for robotics and physics and treat everything else as noise and maybe make some mistake and do some foolish stuff.

Stay Hungry, Stay foolish.
